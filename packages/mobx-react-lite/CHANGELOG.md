# mobx-react-lite

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

-   [`28f8a11d`](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/commit/28f8a11d8b94f1aca2eec4ae9c5f45c5ea2f4362) [#2641](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/pull/2641) Thanks [@urugator](https://github.com/urugator)! - `action`, `computed`, `flow` defined on prototype can be overriden by subclass via `override` annotation/decorator. Previously broken.
    Overriding anything defined on instance itself (`this`) is not supported and should throw. Previously partially possible or broken.
    Attempt to re-annotate property always throws. Previously mostly undefined outcome.
    All annotated and non-observable props (action/flow) are non-writable. Previously writable.
    All annotated props of non-plain object are non-configurable. Previously configurable.
    Observable object should now work more reliably in various (edge) cases.
    Proxied objects now support `Object.defineProperty`. Previously unsupported/broken.
    `extendObservable/makeObservable/defineProperty` notifies observers/listeners/interceptors about added props. Peviously inconsistent.
    `keys/values/entries` works like `Object.keys/values/entries`. Previously included only observables.
    `has` works like `in`. Previously reported `true` only for existing own observable props.
    `set` no longer transforms existing non-observable prop to observable prop, but simply sets the value.
    `remove/delete` works with non-observable and computed props. Previously unsupported/broken.
    Passing `options` to `observable/extendObservable/makeObservable` throws if the object is already observable . Previously passed options were mostly ignored.
    `autoBind` option is now sticky - same as `deep` and `name` option.
    `observable/extendObservable` now also picks non-enumerable keys (same as `make[Auto]Observable`).
    Removed deprecated `action.bound("name")`
    Proxied objects should be compatible with `Reflect` API. Previously throwing instead of returning booleans.

    The `es` folder content is compiled only without transpilation to keep `utils/reactBatchedUpdates` which exists in DOM and RN versions. The bundled `esm` is still kept around too, especially the prod/dev ones that should be utilized in modern browser environments.
